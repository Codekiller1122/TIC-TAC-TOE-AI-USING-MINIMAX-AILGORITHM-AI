# TIC-TAC-TOE-AI-USING-MINIMAX-ALGORITHM
This repository contains a Python implementation of Tic Tac Toe with an AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm. The project includes the following features:

AI Implementation: Utilizes the Minimax algorithm to provide an optimal strategy for the computer player, ensuring challenging gameplay.
Game Board: The game board is displayed in the console, with clear visual representation of player moves and game status.
Human vs AI: Allows players to compete against the computer with options to choose 'X' or 'O' and decide who goes first.
Heuristic Evaluation: The AI evaluates the game board to determine the best possible move, optimizing its chances of winning.
Interactive Console Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for human players to make their moves and view game progress.
The software is implemented under the GNU General Public License (GPL), ensuring it remains open-source and freely available. This implementation demonstrates basic AI principles and can be a useful reference for learning about game theory and algorithms.
